# PMOD2-JoyStick-SPI-Interface
VHDL source, sim, and constraints code for an SPI interface communication between a Nexys4 and a PMOD2 Joystick.

## Summary
This project demonstrates controlling a tri-color LED and a Seven-Segment Display on the Nexys 4 FPGA board via the Pmod JSTK module. It aims for efficient integration using SPI communication, allowing color changes based on joystick movements.
##Use
The system is has only a "one start fire" so after positioning the joystick you pull the start switch and then the SSD and TRI-COLOR LED will turn and remain in an output state until reset.
